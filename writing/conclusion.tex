\section{Conclusion}

Our reachability encoding scheme has shown the ability to compress a large amount of routing information into a small number of bits. Although our experiments were only for the RIPE-available information on 63 participants, in the full iSDX paper the encoding scheme was able to represent subsets of over 500 participants in only 33 bits~\cite{isdx}. We have yet to find an example of an exchange point where this technique breaks down, and so it seems that this approach will allow real software-defined exchange points to be deployed in the near future. 

Since this technique is completed, any future work would be in finding new uses for the technique. However, it would be interesting to explore how this technique could be expanded or modified when additional capabilities are added to SDN switches.
